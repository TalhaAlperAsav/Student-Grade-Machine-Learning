# Overview:
This project aims to evaluate and select the best machine learning model for predicting the final grades of students based on various features such as study time, previous grades, family background, etc.
# Objective:
The main objective is to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting students' final grades and identify the most accurate model.
# Workflow:
## Data Preprocessing: 
The provided dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
## Feature Selection: 
Various feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) are employed to identify the most important features for model training.
## Model Training: 
Several machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and Decision Tree are trained using the preprocessed data.
## Model Evaluation:
Each model is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric to measure its predictive accuracy on unseen test data.
## Model Comparison: 
The RMSE values of all models are compared, and the model with the lowest RMSE is selected as the best performing model.
## Visualization:
Visualizations such as bar plots are created to illustrate the RMSE comparison among different models.
# Dependencies:

R programming language

Libraries: caret, randomForest, gbm, ggplot2
